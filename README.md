For my project, I created a copy of a GOV.UK website, adding features that aren’t foound on the original site with the help of AI. I asked my family for feedback on what they didn’t like about the GOV.UK site, and used their feedback to enhance my protoype.

One of the main features I added was Dyslexia Mode. Family members pointed out to me that people with dyslexia wouldn't be able to read the website, so I added a button to change the background color and increase letter spacing, making it easier to read for people with dyslexia.

I also added Login and Register options. These let users create an account and log in to manage personal information, it also could allow an algorithm to track the users searches to supply them with useful information. My family said this would be helpful, since it’s not available on GOV.UK.

Another feature is a Summary button, which gives users a quick overview of each page. Young members family thought the text on GOV.UK was too long and wordy, so I added this feature to make it easier to understand key points quickly and so they could easily understand it.

I also added a Feedback button so users can share their thoughts and suggestions, which will allow the website to see what it needs to improve on and what to change.

Overall, I wanted to make the website more user-friendly and accessible by addressing common issues people had with the GOV.UK site. However some sites still need to be fully finished and refined and other things such as the algorithm for storing feedback still needs to be made.
